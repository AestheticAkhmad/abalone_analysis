Data analysis on Abalone dataset

Description:
  This file contains the Abalone dataset and the whole workflow I have done on the data set "Abalone."
  The data format for the workflow file is .ows.
  Original format of Abalone dataset was .data, which I converted into the .csv format and added necessary column names.

Installation:
  1. Download the .ows and the .csv files
  2. Put the downloaded files into the same folder
  3. Double click (open) the .ows file
  4. Inside the Orange tool choose the downloaded .csv file
